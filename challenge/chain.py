"""GraphCypherQAChain-style helper for the live-LLM Tier 3 path.

Triple-stated Tier 3 scoring methodology (verbatim in
integration-task-spec.md, the published Integration Guide Tier 3
section, and this docstring):

- The 15 canonical eval questions in data/eval_questions.jsonl are scored by
  exact-result-set equivalence against the deterministic mapper's output on
  the same fixture graph (the deterministic mapper is the gold).
- A Tier 3 answer is correct iff the executed Cypher returns exactly the
  same set of result rows as the deterministic mapper for that question;
  row order matters only for the two ranked questions (#9, #12) where
  ORDER BY is in the canonical shape.
- A Tier 3 answer that raises UnsupportedCypherError (allowlist rejection)
  counts as incorrect for that question but is REPORTED SEPARATELY in the
  autograder summary so learners can distinguish "LLM emitted unsafe Cypher"
  from "LLM emitted safe-but-wrong Cypher".
- Aggregation: report per-question correctness plus an overall accuracy
  (correct / 15). No partial credit on rows.
